## About the Project

This project is a detailed UI clone of the Netflix landing page, meticulously crafted using **only HTML and CSS**. The primary goal was to faithfully replicate the visual design and responsive behavior of the original Netflix entry point, showcasing strong foundational skills in front-end web development.

It stands as an excellent demonstration of:

  - **Responsive Web Design:** Seamlessly adapts its layout and styling across various screen sizes, from large desktops to tablets and mobile phones, solely using CSS media queries.
  - **Modern CSS Layouts:** Leverages **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for efficient and robust content arrangement.
  - **Visual Accuracy:** Mimics Netflix's specific color schemes, typography, spacing, and element positioning.
  - **Clean and Semantic Code:** Structured HTML and well-organized CSS for readability and maintainability.

*(Replace with a link to a Loom video, YouTube video, or a high-quality GIF)*

## Features

  - **Header/Navigation Bar:** Replicated Netflix logo, language selector, and sign-in button.
  - **Hero Section:** Large background image/video placeholder with compelling text and an email input design.
  - **Feature Sections:** "Enjoy on your TV," "Download your shows to watch offline," "Watch everywhere," "Create profiles for kids" sections, complete with corresponding images and text layouts.
  - **FAQ Section (Static):** Visually replicated FAQ section. *Note: As this is HTML/CSS only, the accordion functionality (expand/collapse) is not implemented, but the visual appearance is present.*
  - **Email Input Form:** A fully styled and responsive email input field with a "Get Started" button.
  - **Footer:** Links to various Netflix pages (these are static links for a UI clone).
  - **Purely Responsive Design:** Achieved without any JavaScript, ensuring optimal viewing on all devices.

## Technologies Used

  * **HTML5**: The backbone of the project, providing semantic structure to all content.
  * **CSS3**: Extensively used for all styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), responsiveness (media queries), animations, and transitions.

-----

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to view the project. A code editor (like VS Code) is recommended for exploring or modifying the code.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository Link]
    cd [your-project-name]
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

-----

## Usage

This project is a pure UI demonstration. You can:

  * Explore the **HTML structure (`index.html`)** to understand the semantic markup and organization of content.
  * Analyze the **CSS (`style.css`)** to grasp the styling techniques, responsive breakpoints, and layout methods used (Flexbox, Grid).
  * Use it as a starting point for your own projects or as a reference for learning HTML and CSS.

## Future Enhancements

While this project is purely HTML and CSS, here are some ideas for future expansions if you decide to introduce JavaScript:

  * **Interactive FAQ Accordion:** Add JavaScript to make the FAQ sections expand and collapse.
  * **Form Validation:** Implement client-side validation for the email input.
  * **Dynamic Content:** Fetch content (e.g., movie titles, descriptions) from an API.
  * **More Animations:** Introduce subtle scroll-triggered animations or hover effects using JavaScript.
